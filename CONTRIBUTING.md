  3. Commit your changes:
    
    * Use clear messages to document your commit
    * Include an Emoji de at the beginning of the pull request message, which conforms to the emoji table. See the appropriate emoji [Emojis](#emojis)
  4. Push to your fork and then send a pull request to the **master** branch
